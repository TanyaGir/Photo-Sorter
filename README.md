# Photo-Sorter
TLDR - Will sort your Photos for u and place them neatly in directories first by year and inside them by location.

For any one who wants to know a little more

This is a aprogram that can take a directory of photos and based on thier metadata sort make an API call to fetch more information about the photos like their location and then finally using face detection and text detection sort the photos out to create directories based on their year and place photo taken and place them in such respective folders.
